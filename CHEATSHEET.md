Next.js folder configuration:

pages/: This is the heart of any Next.js application. Each JavaScript file in this directory becomes a route that gets automatically processed and rendered.

pages/index.js: The component exported from this file is rendered at the root URL (/).
pages/about.js: The component exported from this file is rendered at the URL (/about).
pages/[dynamic].js: The component exported from this file is rendered at the URL (/anything), where anything can be any string.
public/: This directory is used to serve static files. Files within this directory can be referenced from your code starting from the base URL (/).

styles/: This directory is for your CSS files. Next.js has built-in support for CSS and Sass which allows you to import .css and .scss files.

components/: This is not a special directory for Next.js, but it's a common practice to have a directory for all your React components.

api/: This is where you put your API routes. Next.js has API routes feature that lets you build your API endpoints with serverless functions.

lib/: This is not a special directory for Next.js, but it's a common practice to have a directory for utility functions and reusable logic.

tests/: This is not a special directory for Next.js, but it's a common practice to have a directory for your tests.

node_modules/: This directory is where your npm dependencies live.

.next/: This is the build output directory, created when you run next build.

package.json: This file is used by npm and yarn to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, version and a whole lot more.

next.config.js: This is a configuration file for Next.js. You can adjust various settings of your Next.js application.

Remember, except for pages/, public/, and .next/, the names of other directories can be customized based on your preference.
